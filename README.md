# Cyber_Text_Detection
This project focuses on detecting harmful or malicious cyber text using machine learning and deep learning models. The models compared in this work include Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and many more. The objective is to classify text data as either cyber-safe or cyber-harmful based on patterns and context.
